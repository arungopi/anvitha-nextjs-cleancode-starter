console.log("package info : Complex Domain Logic Errors:");

/**
  Used for domain-related exceptions that deal with business rules and logic.
  If the errors are related to domain logic (e.g., validation errors specific to business rules),
  they should be placed in the core layer. This keeps domain logic encapsulated
  and focused within the core of your application.
